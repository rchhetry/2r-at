         <h2 class="section-title">Advanced Threat Hunting</h2>
       </div>

       <h3>Overview</h3>
       <p>Advanced Threat Hunting is a proactive cybersecurity discipline focused on actively searching for and isolating threats that have evaded existing security defenses. Unlike traditional security monitoring, which relies on alerts from automated systems, our threat hunters use their expertise, supported by cutting-edge tools and threat intelligence, to manually and iteratively search for Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and Indicators of Attack (IOAs). This human-driven approach is crucial for uncovering sophisticated, stealthy attacks that might otherwise go undetected for extended periods.</p>

       <h3>Key Features & Components</h3>
       <ul>
         <li><strong>Hypothesis-Driven Investigations:</strong> Developing and testing theories about potential attacker presence based on threat intelligence, environmental anomalies, or specific TTPs.</li>
         <li><strong>MITRE ATT&CK Framework Alignment:</strong> Systematically hunting for adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) as defined in the ATT&CK framework.</li>
         <li><strong>Big Data Analytics:</strong> Leveraging security data lakes (SIEM, EDR, logs) to perform complex queries and identify subtle patterns indicative of malicious activity.</li>
         <li><strong>Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Analytics:</strong> Deep dives into endpoint telemetry to uncover suspicious processes, file modifications, and network connections.</li>
         <li><strong>Network Forensics & Traffic Analysis:</strong> Analyzing network flows and packet captures to detect C2 communications, lateral movement, and data exfiltration.</li>
         <li><strong>Behavioral Analysis:</strong> Identifying deviations from normal user and system behavior that could indicate a compromise.</li>
         <li><strong>Custom Scripting & Tooling:</strong> Developing custom scripts and utilizing specialized tools to aid in data collection and analysis during hunts.</li>
       </ul>

       <h3>Our Approach / Methodology</h3>
       <p>Our threat hunting operations follow a structured, iterative process:</p>
       <ol>
         <li><strong>Intelligence Gathering & Hypothesis Formulation:</strong> Based on the latest threat intelligence, recent incidents, or specific organizational risks, our hunters formulate hypotheses about potential threats.</li>
         <li><strong>Data Collection & Triage:</strong> Relevant data from various security tools and logs is collected and prioritized.</li>
         <li><strong>Proactive Searching & Analysis:</strong> Hunters actively search through data, looking for evidence supporting their hypotheses or uncovering new, unexpected indicators.</li>
         <li><strong>Investigation & Validation:</strong> Suspicious findings are thoroughly investigated to confirm if they represent a genuine threat and to understand its scope and nature.</li>
         <li><strong>Containment & Response Orchestration:</strong> If a threat is confirmed, hunters work closely with the incident response team to contain and neutralize it.</li>
         <li><strong>Documentation & Knowledge Transfer:</strong> All findings, methodologies, and new IOCs are documented, feeding back into automated detection systems and improving overall security posture.</li>
       </ol>

       <h3>Benefits for Your Organization</h3>
       <ul>
         <li><strong>Early Detection of Sophisticated Attacks:</strong> Uncover APTs and other advanced threats that bypass conventional defenses.</li>
         <li><strong>Reduced Attacker Dwell Time:</strong> Significantly shorten the time attackers can operate within your network undetected.</li>
         <li><strong>Discovery of Unknown Vulnerabilities & Misconfigurations:</strong> Hunts often reveal previously unknown security gaps.</li>
         <li><strong>Improved Understanding of Your Attack Surface:</strong> Gain insights into how attackers might target your specific environment.</li>
         <li><strong>Enhanced Incident Response Readiness:</strong> Regular hunting exercises improve the skills and preparedness of your security team.</li>
         <li><strong>Actionable Intelligence:</strong> Findings from hunts provide valuable intelligence to strengthen preventative controls and detection mechanisms.</li>
       </ul>

         <h2 class="section-title">Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA)</h2>
       </div>
       <h3>Overview</h3>
       <p>Our Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) service implements a modern security model based on the principle of "never trust, always verify." Unlike traditional VPNs that grant broad network access, ZTNA provides secure, granular, and context-aware access only to specific applications and resources. This approach significantly enhances your organization's security posture by reducing the attack surface and limiting lateral movement in the event of a compromise, irrespective of user location or the device being used.</p>
       <h3>Key Features & Components</h3>
       <ul>
         <li><strong>Identity-Aware Access Policies:</strong> Access decisions are based on verified user identity, device posture, and contextual factors (location, time, application sensitivity).</li>
         <li><strong>Application Micro-segmentation:</strong> Isolates applications from each other, ensuring users only see and access the applications they are explicitly authorized for.</li>
         <li><strong>Secure Application Tunnels (Outbound-Only Connections):</strong> Applications are made invisible to the public internet. Users connect via secure, encrypted tunnels initiated outbound from the user's device to the ZTNA service, then to the application.</li>
         <li><strong>Device Posture Checks & Health Validation:</strong> Verifies the security state of the connecting device (e.g., OS version, antivirus status, disk encryption) before granting access.</li>
         <li><strong>Continuous Authentication and Authorization:</strong> Access is not a one-time grant; it's continuously evaluated and can be revoked if risk factors change.</li>
         <li><strong>Reduced Lateral Movement:</strong> By granting access only to specific applications, ZTNA prevents attackers who compromise an endpoint from easily moving laterally across the network.</li>
         <li><strong>Improved User Experience:</strong> Often provides a more seamless and faster access experience compared to traditional VPNs, especially for remote users.</li>
         <li><strong>Centralized Policy Management & Visibility:</strong> Consistent policy enforcement and detailed audit logs for all access attempts and sessions.</li>
       </ul>
       <h3>Our Approach / Methodology</h3>
       <p>We begin by discovering and inventorying applications that need to be secured. Then, in collaboration with your team, we define granular access policies based on the principle of least privilege. Our phased deployment approach ensures minimal disruption, complemented by comprehensive user training and ongoing policy refinement to adapt to your evolving needs. This includes:</p>
       <ol>
        <li><strong>Application Discovery & Prioritization:</strong> Identifying all internal applications and prioritizing them for ZTNA migration.</li>
        <li><strong>User & Group Mapping:</strong> Defining user roles and groups to map them to specific application access rights.</li>
        <li><strong>Policy Definition:</strong> Creating granular access policies based on identity, device trust, and application context.</li>
        <li><strong>ZTNA Connector Deployment:</strong> Installing lightweight connectors within your data centers or cloud environments where applications reside.</li>
        <li><strong>Client Deployment & User Onboarding:</strong> Deploying ZTNA client software (if needed) to user devices and guiding users through the new access process.</li>
        <li><strong>Testing & Validation:</strong> Thoroughly testing access policies and user experience before full rollout.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitoring & Optimization:</strong> Continuously monitoring ZTNA traffic, access logs, and policy effectiveness, making adjustments as needed.</li>
       </ol>
       <h3>Benefits for Your Organization</h3>
       <ul>
         <li><strong>Significantly Reduced Attack Surface:</strong> Makes applications invisible to unauthorized users and the public internet.</li>
         <li><strong>Enhanced Protection Against Lateral Movement of Threats:</strong> Prevents attackers from easily navigating your internal network after an initial compromise.</li>
         <li><strong>Secure and Seamless Access for Remote and Hybrid Workforces:</strong> Provides consistent security regardless of user location.</li>
         <li><strong>Improved User Experience:</strong> Often faster and more reliable than traditional VPNs, with direct application access.</li>
